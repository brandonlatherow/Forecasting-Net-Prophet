### Through this project, I found that:

- The google search traffic increased by 3008.5 during the month that MercadoLibre released its financial results.
- Search traffic is greater towards the late hours of the night and early hours of the morning.
- Search traffic increases during the winter holiday period.
- There is a slightly negative correlation between lagged search traffic and stock volatility, and a very slightly posivie correlation between lagged search traffic and stock price returns. But since the relationships are so weak, they are also not really predictable.
- The popularity of MercadoLibre shows a decrease in popularity for the near-term.
- 00:00:00 is the most popular time of the day, Tuesday is the most popular day of the week, and Mid-late september is the lowest point for search traffic in the calendar year.
